# Feedback Widget:

- Implements a feedback collection application for Cafe Expresso, allowing users to leave feedback categorized as good, neutral, or bad.
- **Step 1**: Displays the count of collected feedback for each category.
- **Step 2**: Extends the functionality to show additional statistics, including the total count of feedback and the percentage of positive feedback.
- **Step 3**: Refactors the application by separating the statistics display and the feedback buttons into distinct components.
- **Step 4**: Enhances functionality to display statistics only when at least one feedback is collected.
- Incorporates clean JavaScript code adhering to Prettier standards and uses CSS modules or Styled Components for styling.

## Criteria Met:
- Utilizes React as the foundational framework for both projects.
- Provides links to the source code and live working pages on GitHub Pages for each task.
- Ensures error-free execution of the code without any warnings in the console.
- Organizes components in separate files within the 'src/components' directory.
- Implements clear prop passing to components and maintains a clean and understandable codebase.

These project demonstrates a structured approach to solving React-based assignments, showcasing component-based development and adherence to best practices in React.
